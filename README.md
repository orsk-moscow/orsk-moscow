## About me

üëã I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with 6 years of experience driving impactful results through data-driven solutions. I specialize in developing and deploying high-performance machine learning models for various applications, including recommender systems, user acquisition optimization, LLM-powered applications, audio processing, and search algorithms.

## üëÄ My experience includes:

### Leadership and Mentoring

- Scaled the machine learning **team from 4 to 12 members** to meet the demand for personalized products
- **Led engineering teams of up to 12**, owning the full software development lifecycle from concept to production
- Employ a systems approach to software development, resulting in a **50% acceleration of business value delivery**

### Recommender Systems

- Led the development of the **ML backend for a new product**, achieving a **significant growth in user listening time**. Here are some announcements of product launch:
  - [Announcement in company's official blog](https://blog.zvuk.com/article/7ff11900-1fac-44fe-8563-9fa71f8edd40)  
  - [Announcement in an aggregator](https://mobile-review.com/all/news/zvuk-predstavil-personalnuyu-volnu-sila-zvuka/)
- [Repo](https://github.com/orsk-moscow/online-ranker) with RecSys toy example showcase my approach.

### User Acquisition Optimization

- Authored machine learning models for advertising and user acquisition, resulting in a **10% ROI increase**.

### LLM-powered Applications

- Built and deployed a production-ready **AI data processing service** that **cut** customer support **costs by 70%**.
- Conducted applied research of LLMs and Generative AI for 3 company business processes.

### Audio Processing

- Delivered a audio processing pipeline for large-scale musical tracks processing using Airflow, leading to improvement in users' spent time.
